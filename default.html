        <h2>A timeline of Puppy's life achievements:</h2>
        <p><strong>Year 2011</strong> - Started to practice cuteness while performing guard duties, which resulted in burglars being completely demoralized to perform intended robberies.</p>
        <p><strong>Year 2012</strong> - Helped his family, because going on a hike or jog with your pup and your S.O. is active and fun. Doing healthy activities together helps the relationship, and will improve your quality of life overall. Playing with your kitty or puppy is good for the heart and soul.</p>
        <p><strong>Year 2013</strong> - Went to Cincinnati Zoo to visit his friend Alexa. She is a dog that grew up with cheetah Sahara and became close friends, proving that cats and dogs really can get along.</p>
        <p><strong>Year 2014</strong> - Revealed that one of the reasons he accepts life as a pet is because through helping to care for a pet, children learn to care for their fellow human beings. There is an established link between how people treat animals and how they treat each other. Kindness to animals is a lesson that benefits people, too.</p>
        <p><strong>Year 2015</strong> - Joined one of his family members in college to help deal with the stress of homesickness, bad cafeteria food, and course overload</p>
        <p><strong>Year 2016</strong> - Found out about a study where psychological scientists from Hiroshima University in Japan demonstrated that “cute” pictures of baby animals, including puppies and kittens, can have powerful effects on attention and concentration.</p>
